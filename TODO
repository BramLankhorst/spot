 * bookmarks for filter settings
 * download button on the datatable
 * per data-item info view, accessible via clicking on the heatmap, or on individual data points
 * make per widget settings accessible via menu: color scale, ranges, type of axis (logarithmic, etc)
 * rethink lifecycle of crossfilter.dimension()
   For the correlation widget i create an extra dimension and filter, and store it on the view.
   This means the filter is linked to the widget (view) life cycle
 * Move away from Bootstrap; use flex for dynamic layouting.
 * Also have an other look at the CSS styling, why not use plain CSS?
 * Implement new dc.js widgets (scatterplot with box select for instance)
